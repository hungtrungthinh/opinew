# Online Reviews
If you are selling something online, you know how valuable consumer reviews are. For one, consumer reviews increase sales by more than 20%. Consumer-created information, an on-line consumer review, is new information presented from the perspective of consumers who have purchased and used the product. It includes their experiences, evaluations, and opinions. The user-oriented information provided in this way is, in effect, a new kind of word-of-mouth communication. As an independent product-information resource, on-line reviews are increasing in popularity and importance

## Why are online reviews important
Consumers shopping on-line cannot touch or smell products, as would be possible in traditional retail outlets, so their purchase judgments must be based on the product information presented on the Web site. On-line sellers seek to overcome this limitation by giving consumers the opportunity to share product evaluations on-line

But there are a lot of pains associated with managing your own review system:
* Asking your customers by manually sending a lot of emails.
* Making sure that reviews are coming from real people (not bots, hackers or other malicious users of the Internet)
* Making sure that these real people are the same ones who have actually purchased your product (marking reviews as verified)
* Removing spam, haters and the so called trolls.
* Sorting the good reviews from the bad reviews but keeping it fair at the same time.
* Finally, reading the reviews and putting the best ones on top

Why should you care about putting the best ones on top? You already have a lot of reviews and a summary on the top, right?

Well, quantity is just part of the story. Of course, consumers’ purchasing intention increases along with the number of reviews. The existence of many reviews indicates that the product is popular, and this is what increases purchasing intention.

How many reviews are enough? It turns out 85% of people are looking for at least 10 reviews per product. And as a highly cited paper from 2007 shows it doesn’t matter if the customers are high involvement or low-involvement.

But once your customers are the highly involved ones, the ones from which you actually want to keep for longer and make them long lasting customers, quality of your whole brand, including what your existing customers think of you, becomes the single most important factor.

What does matter for these highly involved customers is the quality of the reviews. And this is where we introduce Opinew. 

## Opinew - Beautiful and smart Review System for the New Generation

In our highly competitive times, star ratings just don’t cut it anymore.

Your customers communicate with images, videos and emojis on social networks like Facebook. They use stickers, send selfies and record their voices. Millennials care about specific rather than generic. They are not influenced by traditional advertising, they search from their peers, from people who are like them. They want to see, hear, touch, feel the product, but they also have specific questions they want answered. The new generation is not so easily fooled by traditional marketing.

So that’s where we differentiate from any other review system - we give your customers the opportunity to post beautiful reviews by taking pictures with your products and showcase them.

But that’s far from all we do.

We provide you with the state of the art review system that goes beyond just text and stars. With the proprietary machine learning algorithm, we do all the heavy lifting - we message your customers at the right time, filter and rank the reviews. And best of all - it’s dead easy to setup!

We’ve already helped a number of companies in Glasgow which are happily using our services such as Beauty Kitchen and FatburnExtreme. 

We have a lot of things already done. Let us briefly cover some of the places Opinew really shines and why you can use it today to increase your sales and have better relationship with your customers.

## I don't want negative reviews. 
This is by far the #1 complaint we hear. Here is the controversial truth though: Both good and bad reviews actually help you bring up the trust of your customers! Bad reviews help conversion by 67% Think about it: if you see only positive reviews - you would think there is something doggy going on. So we say: fine, but let’s do it the right way. Our smart algorithms calculate which of these are genuine and message you, the shop owner first, giving you chance to respond and show to others how much you take care of your clients. This is actually the number one fear of most of your customers - if all goes down, will customer support take care of me. When they see that you do indeed follow up, they are much more likely to buy from you. And Opinew helps make that process seamless.

## Sounds like a lot of work...
We try to do as much as we can on our side. Reading and writing papers, pushing the edge of knowledge by doing research with leading experts and developing an awesome online experience. On your side, you just put in a small piece of code on your product pages, similar to the way you put facebook sharing buttons. Currently we are available on the Shopify platform.
When someone receives a product from your store, our smart algorithms determine when is the best time to send them an email asking to write a review

## What if the competition spams?
We are working on a very intelligent system to counter that. State of the art machine learning approach that just gets smarter every day.
What if the company staff writes a lot of reviews for themselves? 
We allow company owners to do that and we mark their reviews with a special badge “By Company Staff”. We try hard to disallow such behaviour. We want authentic reviews. 

## Wait, who are you?
Oh, yeah, sorry, forgot to introduce ourselves!  We are a team of two developers with experience of working at Google. Our paths crossed at the University of Glasgow, Scotland almost four years ago. We like creating things that people enjoy.  Now after five months of development we already have our first clients piloting the platform.
