        <h3>So how does it work?</h3>

        <p>When someone receives a product from your store, we send them a notification on their phone to review it
            with a coupon incentive. The whole thing is gamified - the quicker the user posts a review, the more
            points she gets.</p>

        <p>On your side, you just put in a small piece of code on your product pages, similar to the way you put
            facebook buttons or disqus comments.
            We work with <a target="_blank" href="https://shopify.com">shopify</a> at the moment but we can help you
            with your
            specific platform.</p>

        <h3>I don't want sh*#ty reviews</h3>

        <p>Both good and bad reviews actually help you bring up the trust of your customers. (<a
                href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/8638-bad-reviews-improve-conversion-by-67">Bad reviews help
            conversion by 67%</a>)
            But of course, the
            website is yours and no one likes cr@p. You have full control on moderating the reviews.</p>

        <h3>I don't have time to moderate</h3>

        <p>You can switch on our automatic computer magic do that for you.
