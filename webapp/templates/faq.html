                <h3>So how does it work?</h3>

                <p>On your side, you just put in a small piece of code on your product pages, similar to the way you put
                    facebook sharing buttons.
                    Currently we are available on the Shopify platform.</p>

                <p>When someone receives a product from your store, we send them an email asking to write a review.</p>
