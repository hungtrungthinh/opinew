3,"Love my new blazer jacket and skirt pants. Accidental match! Inexpensive, comfortable, nice fabric, perfect for spring and autumn. ",5,bobi_blazer.jpg,17,3,1
4,Very compact; lovely design. It detangles hair more easily and makes it smooth and shiny but doesn't actually reduce hair loss so I don't think it's worth all the hype OR the price. ,3,bobi_hairbrush.jpg,17,4,1
5,"A great device! The design is simple and elegant. Pretty cheap, only 350 euro with Nvidia GPU and Intel i3 processor, tough only 4GB RAM. Only drawback is the battery 2400mAh, but for that price it's perfect ",5,chavdar_laptop.jpg,7,5,1

10,"This Kindle has served me for almost 3 years. It has battery that lasts literally for weeks or months when I don't have time to read. It saves me from carrying tons of heavy books, it is very compact, lightweight, great value for money!",5,iva_kindle.jpg,9,10,1
11,"Stylish flash drive, decent amount of storage, but the transfer speeds :( are extremely low.",2,ivo_flash.jpg,4,11,1
12,"Decent WiFi dongle, good range, but transfer speeds could be better, a lot better. All in all it does the job. ",3,ivo_wifi.jpg,4,12,1
13,This is a gamebook. It's very interesting and exiting. You can entertain everywhere with it. It is also very cheap,5,katq_book.jpg,5,13,1
14,"Walking through a forest with Concerning Hobbits playing from your rucksack is priceless. You can also hide it and prank your friends in various ways (noise of breaking glass works well).Bit pricey and heavy, but satisfyingly loud (indoors) considering its 30 cm size. Simple to connect with any bluetooth-equipped phone, charge it with a phone charger. Very decent battery life for most occasions (7h).",5,peter_speakers.jpg,7,14,1
15,"It helped me win duels with my pal in Rome. I got two for my 18th birthday but they lasted just 10 minutes, this one unexpectedly hangs on. A fun temporary toy, though you have to be careful not to destroy it immediately. Best used as a goofy costume addition. P.S. security guards (airport, Vatican, museums...) will examine the sword thoroughly. Got stabbed once.",4,peter_sword.jpg,7,15,1
16,"Perfect cosy and comfy fluffy outfit for a typical Glasgow day smile emoticon However, it could be warmer..",4,sabrina_pijamas.jpg,14,16,1
17,Great for a quick game with your friends. Simple rules make it easy to explain to people who never played before. High quality and style of the board and figures make the experience even better. Not for People who prefer long games with more strategy involved. ,4,tom_game.jpg,2,17,1
18,"I wanted a pair of good sounding earphones(oh and im picky about those :p). So I bought Betron earphones from Amazon and had to return them. Then I bought those. Super duper positively surprised. That sort of build and sound quality for 25 quid? Probably because they are discontinuing the collection. Anyway. Sound is good on the whole range, bass is a tiny bit bumped but in a good way. Can't say anything bad about them apart from the cable that generates a bit too much noise. Still I totally recommend if you need a pair of good earphones",5,tom_headphones.jpg,2,18,1
19,Best headphones I have ever had. Sound quality is amazing on the whole range. Sometimes I was surprised that I could notice a lot of tiny little details I've never heard before in my old music pieces I've listened for years. I rediscovered music again. Other than sounsturbation - perfect for working in an office. They isolate well and don't let the sound out so you won't annoy others around you. ,5,tom_headphones1.jpg,2,19,1
20,"excellent screen sound system, best on the market performance/price ratio, absolutely badass looks ",5,vasil_laptop.jpg,13,20,1
